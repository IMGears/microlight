## About
Microlight is a light weight task runner. Compare this to rundeck but much simpler and runs on a single instance only. The idea is simplicity. Microlight can only vertically scale. That might limit scale for large usecases, but for small simple use cases, it makes the tool so much more simpler to use. 

This repository only install @microlight/core as a dependancy. Its suggested to install @microlight/cli globally to use the command line. This repo contains all the tasks configured to run via microlight
