## About
Microlight is a light weight task runner. Compare this to rundeck but much simpler and runs on a single instance only. The idea is simplicity. Microlight can only vertically scale. That might limit scale for large usecases, but for small simple use cases, it makes the tool so much more simpler to use. 

## Getting started
Read the docs

Microlight has 2 main packages 
- @microlight/cli
- @microlight/core

CLI is optional. CLI helps you create new project, new tasks etc with ease.
